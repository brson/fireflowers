<div class="post-section">

<p>
  Rust is a <em>systems programming language</em> that is
  perhaps most notable for being <em>memory safe without garbage
  collection</em>. It was designed to solve problems observed
  maintaining the millions of lines of C++ in the Firefox web
  browser. It is fast, reliable, and runs on most anything, and its
  enthusiasts are exceptionally enthusiastic about its potential.
</p>

<p>
  On December 29, 2016, Steve Klabnik, author of
  <a href="http://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Book</a>
  and member of the Rust core team, blogged,
  <a href="http://words.steveklabnik.com/rust-is-more-than-safety">"Rust
  is more than safety"</a>, saying that memory safety alone is not
  convincing for some prospective Rust users. This catalyzed a
  blogsplosion the likes of which Rustaceans had never seen (and
  Rustaceans love blogging), where Rust's creators and users offered
  their opinions about what makes Rust so exciting.
</p>

<p>
  This is a summary of that.

  In this initial post, Steve claims that "Rust is most well-known
  for its features around writing <em>low-level code</em> in a safer
  way than its predecessors. But it’s also a lot more than that."  He
  suggests that Rust brings established modern programming language
  theory to the domain of systems programming, emphasizing a slogan
  from Rust's creator, Graydon Hoare:
</p>

<blockquote id="tech-past-quote">
  <p>Technology from the past<br>come to save the future from itself</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  The rediscovery and application of old, reliable, and sometimes
  forgotten technology is one of the themes the name "Rust" evokes.
  Rust applies some established techniques from academia to
  industry. Steve doesn't elaborate, but two obvious examples are that
  Rust includes <em>algebraic data types</em>, common in the ML family
  of languages, and in Rust known as "enums"; and <em>traits</em>,
  which enable polymorphism similar to Haskell's type classes, but
  fairly unlike C++ classes and templates.
</p>

<p>
  How Rust innovates the greatest is by <em>statically tracking
  ownership and lifetimes of all variables and their
  references</em>. The ownership system enables Rust to automatically
  deallocate and run destructors on all values immediately when they
  go out of scope, and prevents values from being accessed after they
  are destroyed. It is what makes Rust memory safe and thread safe,
  and why it doesn't need a GC to accomplish that.
</p>

<p>
  And that's cool. But, as Steve goes on to say, "your marketing
  should be focused on what problems your product solves for the
  consumer". Being memory safe (i.e. "not crashing") is nice, but many
  programmers of languages with garbage collectors enjoy that comfort
  today, and <em>some C and C++ programmers are dismissive of the
  value of memory safety</em>, possibly believing they have a handle
  on the matters of memory management and concurrency.

    <p><em>The borrow checker is amazing! I hated it at first, but ownership and
      lifetimes don't just bring sense to multithreaded and concurrent
      programming, they also make your own data designs so much cleaner!</em></p>

    <p>Rust, through ownership, effectively enforces the higher-level single
      responsibility principle that sometimes is a struggle to be consistent
      about in other languages. That alone is amazing.</p>

    <p>But for me, what really gets me is how expressive it can be and yet it
      seems like we lose nothing in terms of security, reliability,

    <p>Rust makes it easier to write correct and readable code, and
      getting both at the same time is not a coincidence.</p>

    <p><em>The very mechanisms of ownership/borrowing (a tight control
      over lifetime, aliasing and mutability) enforce a certain
      simplicity in the data-flow of the resulting software that you
      could get in other programming languages, but generally do not
      because the language was more lenient and you got away with a
      more convoluted flow.</em></p>

    <p>Have you ever had to debug a ConcurrentModificationException in
      Java?  This happens when you modify a container being iterated
      over. When you have a chain of callbacks/observers, it's
      incredibly easy to accidentally have a circular reference
      leading to this exception. In Rust, to get to this situation you
      have to use RefCell or equivalent, and it should make you
      pause.</p>

    <p>Another thing I love with Rust is its balance between ease of use and
      fastness. Not only there are lots of high level features that are
      really cool in the language, but cargo/crates.io makes publishing a
      package very easy; while dynamically typed languages might seem easier
      sometimes I feel that if you are not rigorous (and I'm not, see the
      beginning of this comment :p) it's difficult to buy medium-scaled
      projects in them; and at the same time Rust is fast, and even when
      performances aren't critical, well, it's always good, plus in my
      experience some thing that isn't performance-critical can quickly
      become it (e.g. it doesn't matter if it takes 10ms or 100 when you run
      something as a command line, but then you're like "hey I could turn
      that into a webservice too" and it starts to matter).</p>

    <p><em>There are a few languages I am quite familiar with, and some that I
      really like, but Rust is the one I found the most empowering</em>. The
      problem with "safety" is that in programming when I read that word I
      tend to think that it's something for low-level stuff or things that
      can have security issues and I don't usually need that, but in the end
      <em>I think that safety also leads to confidence</em>: my code
      might not be best written, but with the compiler I can be
      confident that it's relatively correct (obviously it can't catch
      everything but well), which isn't the case with most other
      languages.</p>

      <li><em>Fast program execution</em>. Sometimes you just want the
        speed that a scripting language cannot provide. Although I
        have to admit that many times Python is fast enough. I also
        pick D sometimes to write fast "scripts".

      <li><em>Reliability</em>. Rust is a language that puts an
        emphasis on correct and reliable programs. The compiler does a
        great job at pointing me at pieces of code that I should think
        about again. It is similar to Haskell in that "if it compiles,
        it is likely correct". You pay upfront for long "talk to the
        compiler" sessions, but from experience I'd say that it pays
        off.

      <li><em>A language that is a joy to use</em>. There are some
        really great languages that I love to use. They include
        Clojure, Lua, Python and Rust. The first two languages are
        mostly the products from single inventors with good taste plus
        a couple of contributors. The last two are the product of
        their respective communities. The Rust community tries to
        bring together the best ideas and lessons from different
        programming languages and has a democratic development process
        that tries to create a language and an ecosystem that is nice
        to use and plays well together with Rust's goals.

      <li><em>A new language with stable releases</em>. I like to try
        new programming languages from time to time. It is cool that
        you can pick between stable, beta and nightly, depending on
        your stability needs. Furthermore, you can count on Rust being
        around for longer because Mozilla is supporting the language.

    <p>It's really difficult for me to talk about rust without talking about

    <p><em>One thing I don't think gets touched on enough is how much
      easier refactoring is</em> because of the borrow checker. I
      think it's easier to see the lifetime of objects in rust, so
      it's easier to find blocks of code that can be extracted into a

    <p>Concrete practical points that might interest a C programmer/engineer:
      (Those are obviously obvious to /r/rust regulars)</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The language is relatively small. -- That's rarely mentioned.

      <li>No more wrapping std functions for safety and error-checking. Or
        banning some of the functions that are deemed dangerous. Or using a
        complete safe replacement library because you don't trust yourself
        or others.

      <li>Abstractions are opt-in. Safe guards are opt-out.

      <li>The language is not OOP-centric. You wouldn't be forced into a
        paradigm that never made sense to you. Or forced to use needless
        abstractions you never liked.

      <li>You can use native performant libraries freely. You will never have
        to check if a library is shipped by all major distributions. You
        don't have to worry about the versions shipped. -- More maturity and
        completeness in the crate ecosystem is essential here.

      <li>Static checking is (mostly) built-in. You don't have to depend on
        imperfect proprietary tools/services like Coverity anymore.

      <li>A build tool is included. And the build process is unified and
        streamlined. No more autotools/CMake/(g|n|b|p|f|s|d)make/etc
        shenanigans.
    </ul>

    <p>This relates better, IMHO, to the pain points C users face, than
      general talk about safety design. Once a user dips their toes in
      Rust. They will start to grasp the bigger picture.</p>

    <p>Rust, to me, has a number of things going for it beyond
      safety:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><em>If it compiles, it works</em>: Rust and Haskell are the
        only languages I've seen where this has regularly been the
        case.

      <li><em>Embedding: I think this is a killer feature</em>. If you
        want to make a native extension for python, ruby, nodejs or
        erlang to get some additional performance or to integrate with
        native libraries rust is a great way to do it. The absence of
        a GC in rust lets it cooperate with other language runtimes
        without issues. This is an area where the only other
        competition has been C or C++.

      <li><p><em>Dependency management</em>: Rust doesn't just provide
          a better dependency management situation vs C and C++ but
          other languages too. I like working with cargo more than pip
          or npm and because it is the official tool it seems rust
          will be able to avoid the proliferation and fragmentation of
          tools that other languages have experienced.

      timesink in almost all systems languages. While CMake and

      enormous pain and a barrier to sharing and reusing code. You are
      often forced to re-invent the wheel -- complete with your own

    <p><em>I haven't developed this thesis fully, but I've been

      obviously not a pure functional language). The point of
      functional programming is to avoid shared mutable state by
      eliminating all side effects and using a rich type system that's
      hopefully easy for the programmer to use. <em>Rust avoids unsafe

      multithreaded code if you're using any kind of shared data,
      and <em>Rust is the only language I know of that truly makes it

    <p>As a trivial example, some time ago I fixed a subtle threading bug in
      fish-shell. The code used RAII and lock guards, which is good, but in
      this particular case the lock guard was created using the wrong
      lock. So it was locking, it just wasn't locking the correct lock,
      meaning the data it was mutating was subject to a data race. As I

<p>
  So in response to Steve's post there were a number of opinions
  expressed about Rust, and about the importance of "safety". In this
  response, Graydon Hoare, Rust's erstwhile creator, reminds us that
  "safety in the systems space is Rust's raison d'être. Especially
  safe concurrency."
</p>

<p>
  Graydon has strong words for C++ programmers who deny the importance
  of memory safety:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>
    When someone says they "don't have safety problems" in C++, I am
    astonished: a statement that must be made in ignorance, if not
    outright negligence. The fact of the matter is that the further down
    the software stack one goes, the worse the safety situation
    gets. Our engineering discipline has this dirty secret, but it is
    not so secret anymore: every day the world stumbles forward on
    creaky, malfunctioning, vulnerable, error-prone systems software and
    every day the toll in human misery increases. Billions of dollars,
    countless lives lost. Can one really say "I don't have safety
    problems" in systems programming?"
  </em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  He asserts that "Rust's success in raising the bar for
  safe, concurrent systems programming &mdash; in ways that the niche finds
  usable, performant and compatible &mdash; cannot (imo) be
  overstated. That is its purpose, and that has been its great
  success."

    <p>What's the difference? Both of the statements have the premise
      that Rust is – and ought to be – a safe systems programming
      language. However, the latter captures not only the REAL goal,
      but also the nuances and tensions: while safety is
      indispensable, we must do something else too, for the
      programming society to accept the safe tools we are trying to
      promote. That means ergonomics, that means performance, that
      means ease of use, that means wide availability – and that might
      also mean advocation of visions of a better world, which is what
      this blog post of Graydon's does.</p>

    <p>Talking about the safety is fundamentally not so attractive to
      many of our potential users -- they're either C/C++ people who
      have evolved coping strategies to deal with all the pitfalls, or
      they're dynamic language people who get the safety, too, just at
      a performance cost.</p>

    <p>So, I really like the "fearless" part. For me personally, the
      "concurrency" part isn't as interesting; really, how much of the
      code you write on a day-to-day basis needs to reckon with
      concurrency issues? I would think that's a tiny percentage for
      most developers. One could argue that this is exactly because
      concurrency is so bothersome/failure-prone in most existing
      advantages, but then we're back to the "eat your vegetables"
      argument.</p>

    <p>So maybe it would be better to talk about "fearless
      performance", or "fearless zero-cost abstractions", or
      "low-level control without the hazards".</p>

    <p><em>Rust gives you fearlessness in all the things, but it does mean
      learning new style and discovering new solutions to old
      problems</em>. To fully understand 'Send' vs. 'Sync', for example,
      means really groking the Rust type system. Once you get the type
      system, then fully utilizing it with the expressive generics
      becomes unlocked, and then at that point you've transcended from
      Rust dabbler to fully fearless Rust user.</p>

    <p>Once this world of development is unlocked to you it is
      mind-blowing, but it is a journey to get there, and not everyone
      will have the heart to make it. It comes in stages, is
      wonderfully rewarding, will make you a better programmer in you
      other favorite languages, but I think we should be careful with
      statements like 'Rust makes it easy'.</p>

    <p>It does make hard things easy, but only after you've fully embraced
      Rust. This feels more accurate: <em>"Hey, you know that thing that's
      really hard for you? Rust makes it fun."</em></p>

    <p>I'm a lowly ancient Java programmer and I think Rust is far far
      more than safety.</p>

    <p>In my opinion Rust is about doing things right. It may have
      been about safety at first but I think it is more than that
      given the work of the community.</p>

    <p>Yes I know there is the right tool for the right job and is
      impossible to fill all use cases but IMO Rust is striving for
      iPhone like usage.</p>

    <p>I have never seen a more disciplined and balanced community
      approach to creating PL. Everything seems to be carefully
      thought out and iterated on. There is a lot to be said to this
      (although ironically I suppose one could call that safe)!</p>

    <p>PL is more than the language. It is works, community and
    mindshare.

    <p>If Rust was so concerned with safety I don't think much work
      would be done on making it so consumable for all with continuous
      improvements of compiler error messages, easier syntax and
      improved documentation.</p>

    <p><em>Rust is one of the first languages in a long time that makes
      you think different.</em></p>

    <p>If it is just safety... safety is one overloaded word.</p>

<p>
  So this is where we come to fireflowers. Dave Herman is a founder of
  Mozilla Research, a member of TC39, the JavaScript standards body,
  one of Rust's greatest advocates, and he likes vivid metaphors.
</p>

<p>
  The fireflower in the title is a metaphor drawn from Super Mario
  Bros. In the game, when Mario eats a Fire Flower, he becomes Fire
  Mario, a fireball-throwing badass. In the metaphor, which Dave
  attributes to Samuel Hulick, one wants your users (Mario) to feel
  like Fire Mario when they use your product (Fire Flowers).
</p>

<p>
  And Dave's point is that
  <em>safety is the Fire Flower that enables Rust developers to be
  Fire Mario</em>.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="flreqn">

<p>
  He then goes on to talk about the superpowers the Rust Fire Flower
  gives to Rust Fire Marios:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>So what's badass about programming in Rust? I think it's being a
    systems programmer. There's nothing a systems programmer can't do:
    write an OS from scratch; drive micro-controllers; outcompete the
    fastest software in a crowded category; it's all within reach.</em></p>

  <p>But for most programmers, the prospect of writing C or C++ code
    &mdash; and certainly the thought of actually shipping it &mdash;
    is so terrifying we don't usually even waste much time considering
    it.</p>

  <p>This is why I believe <em>hack without fear</em> resonates:
    safety clears one of the biggest obstacles preventing people from
    seeing themselves as systems programmers.</p>

    <p>One very important thing that isnt emphasized enough is

    <p>With C and C++ the barrier of entry is harder.</p>

    <p>This is huge. This means <em>more devs can become systems
      programmers</em>. More people writing systems software. I think
      this is why rust has more success recruiting new devs from
      higher level languages and newbies than C/C++ devs.</p>

    <p>In that sense, the fire flower makes systems programming
      accessible. And fire mario are devs who can write system
      programs.</p>

<p>
  Steve is into the "fearless" theme and suggests that being fearless
  makes you Fire Mario, whereas safety remains just the Fire Flower:
  "I’m not saying that we get rid of fire flowers. I’m saying that we
  focus on 'Rust makes you Fire Mario', not 'Rust is made of fire
  flowers', when talking to people about Rust." (But "Rust is made of
  fire flowers" <i>sounds</i> amazing, right? I don't think that can
  be disputed.)
</p>

<p>
  He drives the point home:
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    <em>I think one of Rust’s greatest potentials ... is bringing a
    ton of new people into systems programming</em>. But my point is
    this: “memory safety without garbage collection” doesn’t speak to
    that at all. That is, memory safety without garbage collection is
    the mechanism of how that’s accomplished, but it’s not the
    accomplishment itself. It’s the Fire Flower, not Fire Mario.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’d like to make sure we’re talking about being Fire Mario, rather
    than being Fire Flower enthusiasts.
